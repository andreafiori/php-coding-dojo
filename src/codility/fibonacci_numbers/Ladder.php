/*
You have to climb up a ladder. The ladder has exactly N rungs, numbered from 1 to N.
With each step, you can ascend by one or two rungs. More precisely:

        with your first step you can stand on rung 1 or 2,
        if you are on rung K, you can move to rungs K + 1 or K + 2,
        finally you have to stand on rung N.

Your task is to count the number of different ways of climbing to the top of the ladder.

For example, given N = 4, you have five different ways of climbing, ascending by:

        1, 1, 1 and 1 rung,
        1, 1 and 2 rungs,
        1, 2 and 1 rung,
        2, 1 and 1 rungs, and
        2 and 2 rungs.

Given N = 5, you have eight different ways of climbing, ascending by:

        1, 1, 1, 1 and 1 rung,
        1, 1, 1 and 2 rungs,
        1, 1, 2 and 1 rung,
        1, 2, 1 and 1 rung,
        1, 2 and 2 rungs,
        2, 1, 1 and 1 rungs,
        2, 1 and 2 rungs, and
        2, 2 and 1 rung.

The number of different ways can be very large, so it is sufficient to return the result modulo 2^P,
for a given integer P.

Write a function:

    function solution($A, $B);

that, given two non-empty zero-indexed arrays A and B of L integers, returns an array consisting
of L integers specifying the consecutive answers; position I should contain the number of different
ways of climbing the ladder with A[I] rungs modulo 2^B[I].

For example, given L = 5 and:

    A[0] = 4   B[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4   B[1] = 2
    A[2] = 5   B[2] = 4
    A[3] = 5   B[3] = 3
    A[4] = 1   B[4] = 1

the function should return the sequence [5, 1, 8, 0, 1], as explained above.

Assume that:
        L is an integer within the range [1..30,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..L];
        each element of array B is an integer within the range [1..30].

Complexity:
        expected worst-case time complexity is O(L);
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(L),
        beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.
