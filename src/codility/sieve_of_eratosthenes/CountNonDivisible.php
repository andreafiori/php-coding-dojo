/*
You are given an array A consisting of N integers.

For each number A[i] such that 0 ≤ i < N, we want to count the number of elements
of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say that these elements are non-divisors.

For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6

For the following elements:

    A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
    A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
    A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
    A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
    A[6] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.

Write a function:

    function solution($A);

that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns a
sequence of integers representing the amount of non-divisors.

The sequence should be returned as:

    a structure Results (in C), or
    a vector of integers (in C++), or
    a record Results (in Pascal), or
    an array of integers (in any other programming language).

For example, given:
    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6

the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.

Assume that:
    N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
    each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].

Complexity:
    expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
    expected worst-case space complexity is O(N),
    beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.
