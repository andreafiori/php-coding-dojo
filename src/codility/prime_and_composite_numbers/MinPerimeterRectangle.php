/*
An integer N is given, representing the area of some rectangle.

The area of a rectangle whose sides are of length A and B is A * B,
and the perimeter is 2 * (A + B).

The goal is to find the minimal perimeter of any rectangle whose area equals N.
The sides of this rectangle should be only integers.

For example, given integer N = 30, rectangles of area 30 are:

        (1, 30), with a perimeter of 62,
        (2, 15), with a perimeter of 34,
        (3, 10), with a perimeter of 26,
        (5, 6), with a perimeter of 22.

Write a function:

    function solution($N);

that, given an integer N,
returns the minimal perimeter of any rectangle whose area is exactly equal to N.

For example, given an integer N = 30, the function should return 22, as explained above.

Assume that:
        N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

Complexity:
        expected worst-case time complexity is O(sqrt(N));
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).
