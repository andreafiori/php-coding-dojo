/*
A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of the letters A, C, G and T,
which correspond to the types of successive nucleotides in the sequence.
Each nucleotide has an impact factor, which is an integer.
Nucleotides of types A, C, G and T have impact factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
You are going to answer several queries of the form: What is the minimal impact factor of nucleotides
contained in a particular part of the given DNA sequence?

The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string S = S[0]S[1]...S[N-1] consisting of N characters.
There are M queries, which are given in non-empty arrays P and Q, each consisting of M integers.
The K-th query (0 ≤ K < M) requires you to find the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained
in the DNA sequence between positions P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive).

For example, consider string S = CAGCCTA and arrays P, Q such that:

    P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
    P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
    P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6

The answers to these M = 3 queries are as follows:

        The part of the DNA between positions 2 and 4 contains nucleotides G and C (twice),
        whose impact factors are 3 and 2 respectively, so the answer is 2.
        The part between positions 5 and 5 contains a single nucleotide T,
        whose impact factor is 4, so the answer is 4.
        The part between positions 0 and 6 (the whole string) contains all nucleotides,
        in particular nucleotide A whose impact factor is 1, so the answer is 1.

Write a function:

    function solution($S, $P, $Q);

that, given a non-empty zero-indexed string S consisting of N characters
and two non-empty zero-indexed arrays P and Q consisting of M integers,
returns an array consisting of M integers specifying the consecutive answers to all queries.

The sequence should be returned as:

        a Results structure (in C), or
        a vector of integers (in C++), or
        a Results record (in Pascal), or
        an array of integers (in any other programming language).

For example, given the string S = CAGCCTA and arrays P, Q such that:

    P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
    P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
    P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6

the function should return the values [2, 4, 1], as explained above.

Assume that:
        N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
        M is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
        each element of arrays P, Q is an integer within the range [0..N − 1];
        P[K] ≤ Q[K], where 0 ≤ K < M;
        string S consists only of upper-case English letters A, C, G, T.

Complexity:
        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N+M);
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(N),
        beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.
