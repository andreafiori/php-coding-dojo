/*
A string S consisting of N characters is considered to be properly nested
if any of the following conditions is true:

        S is empty;
        S has the form "(U)" or "[U]" or "{U}" where U is a properly nested string;
        S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.

For example, the string "{[()()]}" is properly nested but "([)()]" is not.

Write a function:

    function solution($S);

that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if S is properly nested and 0 otherwise.

For example, given S = "{[()()]}", the function should return 1 and given S = "([)()]",
the function should return 0, as explained above.

Assume that:
        N is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
        string S consists only of the following characters: "(", "{", "[", "]", "}" and/or ")".

Complexity:
        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(N)
        (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
